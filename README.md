# Clustering Analysis on Loan Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Clustering_analysis_Loan_V1.ipynb`) that performs **unsupervised learning techniques** to analyze and cluster loan-related data. The main objective is to identify meaningful patterns and group customers/loans based on their characteristics, which can help financial institutions with **risk segmentation**, **customer profiling**, and **decision-making**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Perform **data preprocessing** on a loan dataset (handling missing values, encoding, scaling, etc.).
- Apply **clustering algorithms** such as:
  - K-Means
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - DBSCAN (if included)
- Use **dimensionality reduction (PCA)** for visualization.
- Evaluate clustering results using metrics such as **Silhouette Score**.
- Visualize clusters for better understanding.
